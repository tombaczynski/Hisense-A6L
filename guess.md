What has roots as nobody see,  
Is taller than trees,  
Up, up it goes,  
And yet never grows?  

Voiceless it cries,
Wingless flutters,
Toothless bites,
Mouthless mutters.

This thing all things devours:
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron, bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town,
And beats high mountain down.
